#Drama-tify
A React based movie dashboard that lets you search movies by titles, show you trending movies/top rated movies and lets you 
categorize them in different cateogaries. That is, you can shortlist movies based on your watched list/downloaded/todownload etc and customize them according to your need! I have used TMDB Api to gather movie data and firebase for Authentication. 
For ease, I'm locally storing data on client side. 
Also, the application looks ugly as of now since the focus was on learning the functionality, I'm gonna update CSS in the next version.
